Supercharge your shortcuts with lots of useful actions.

It provides additional actions for the Shortcuts app.

The actions are not able to run on Apple Watch or HomePod.

Restart your device if the actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app.

The app is free without ads because I love making apps. Consider leaving a nice review.
